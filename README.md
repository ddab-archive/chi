For information about using the program see the WinHelp help file or `Src/CHI/Help/CHI.rtf`.

## Final Release

The final release of the program is [v3.0.0](https://github.com/ddab-archive/chi/releases/tag/v3.0.0-FINAL).

## Source Code

The source code was not originally developed under version control. Eventually the source code was moved to a Subversion repository. A summary of changes made before moving to version control can be found in [`Docs/PreSVNHistory.txt`](https://github.com/ddab-archive/chi/blob/main/Docs/PreSVNHistory.txt). The remainder of the history was recorded in the Subversion repo, a dump of which has been uploaded to `SVN/chi-svndump.zip` [[download](https://github.com/ddab-archive/chi/raw/main/SVN/chi-svndump.zip)].

### Commits since the last release

The `main` branch of this project differs from the final release in two ways:

1. This `README.md` file has been added for display by GitHub.
2. `8queens-svndump.zip` was uploaded to the `SVN` directory, as noted above.

The source code as it was at the final release can be viewed on GitHub by switching to the [`v3.0.0-FINAL`](https://github.com/ddab-archive/chi/releases/tag/v3.0.0-FINAL) tag.

## License

The executable code is covered by the EULA described in `Docs/License.rtf`.

Much of the source code released under the [Mozilla Public License v1.1](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/1.1/).
